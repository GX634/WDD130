      <p>My state is secluded from the rest of the USA, usually defined as the forgotten state. Not many people know what's in North Dakota, probably because there is almost nothing of interest there, besides maybe the geographical center of North America. Anyways, that's about all I have to say about the state where I am from.</p>
