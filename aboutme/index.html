    <p>Hi, my name is Carter Withers, and I like to code in HTML. I also like to play video games, specifically Minecraft at the moment, as I am now getting back into it. I also like to solve Rubik's cubes, and play with my cats. I am the oldest child in a family of 6, and I have 3 sisters that are all younger than me. I am also left handed.</p>
